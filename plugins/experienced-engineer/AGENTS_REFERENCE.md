## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Combine Agents**: Use multiple specialists for comprehensive reviews
2. **Be Specific**: Provide file paths and specific concerns
3. **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper
4. **Context Matters**: Share relevant background information
5. **Use `/code-explain` First**: Understand existing code before consulting agents

---

## üìù Commands Reference

### `/code-explain <query>`
Deep dive into codebase to answer questions about how things work, what code does, where things are implemented, and why they're done a certain way.

**Examples:**
- `/code-explain How does authentication work?`
- `/code-explain Where is payment processing implemented?`
- `/code-explain What does the rate limiter middleware do?`

### `/update-claude`
Update the CLAUDE.md file to reflect major changes in the codebase. Keeps project documentation current for Claude and your team.

**When to use:**
- After major refactoring
- After adding new features or modules
- After architectural changes
- When structure changes significantly
