# Experienced Engineer Plugin

A comprehensive Claude Code plugin that provides specialized engineering subagents and productivity commands to help software teams work more efficiently.

## Overview

The Experienced Engineer plugin gives you instant access to specialized expert agents covering all major roles in a software engineering team. Whether you need help with API design, security review, performance optimization, or testing strategies, this plugin has you covered.

## Features

### 🤖 Specialized Subagents

Access expert-level guidance from 10 specialized engineering roles:

- **API Architect** - Design robust, scalable APIs with REST, GraphQL, and proper versioning
- **Security Specialist** - Identify vulnerabilities and implement secure coding practices
- **Code Quality Reviewer** - Maintain high code quality with SOLID principles and clean code
- **UX/UI Designer** - Create intuitive, accessible interfaces with great user experience
- **Database Architect** - Design efficient schemas and optimize database performance
- **Performance Engineer** - Identify bottlenecks and optimize application performance
- **DevOps Engineer** - Set up CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and deployment automation
- **Testing Specialist** - Implement comprehensive testing strategies and automation
- **Documentation Writer** - Create clear, comprehensive technical documentation
- **Tech Lead** - Get architectural guidance and technical leadership insights

### ⚡ Productivity Commands

#### `/code-explain`
Deep dive into your codebase to answer questions and explain functionality:
- "How does authentication work?"
- "What does this function do?"
- "Where is the payment processing implemented?"

Get thorough explanations with code snippets, execution flow, and architectural context.

#### `/update-claude`
Automatically update your `CLAUDE.md` file to reflect major changes in the codebase. This command helps keep your project documentation current so Claude (and your team) always has an up-to-date understanding of your architecture.

### 🎣 Smart Hooks

**Auto-Documentation Hook**: Automatically prompts to update `CLAUDE.md` after detecting significant code changes (50+ lines modified). This ensures your project documentation stays in sync with major refactoring or feature additions.

## Installation

### From Marketplace

```bash
# Add the marketplace (if not already added)
/plugin marketplace add claude-code-marketplace

# Install the plugin
/plugin install experienced-engineer@claude-code-marketplace
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Add local marketplace
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/claude-code-marketplace

# Install plugin
/plugin install experienced-engineer@claude-code-marketplace
```

## Usage

### Using Subagents

Access any specialist agent through the `/agent` command:

```bash
# Get API design review
/agent api-architect

# Security code review
/agent security-specialist

# Performance optimization suggestions
/agent performance-engineer
```

Or use the interactive agent selector:

```bash
/agents
```

Then select the specialist you need.

### Using Commands

#### Code Explanation

```bash
# Ask about any part of your codebase
/code-explain How does the authentication middleware work?

# Get detailed explanations
/code-explain Where is the database connection pool configured?
```

#### Documentation Updates

```bash
# Manually trigger CLAUDE.md update
/update-claude
```

Or let the auto-hook prompt you after major changes!

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: When consulting agents, provide context about what you're working on
2. **Combine Agents**: Use multiple specialists for comprehensive reviews
3. **Use Code Explain**: Before making changes, use `/code-explain` to understand existing code
4. **Keep Docs Updated**: Let the auto-hook update your CLAUDE.md regularly
5. **Iterative Consulting**: Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper

## Examples

### Example 1: API Design Review

```bash
/agent api-architect
"Review the REST API endpoints in /src/routes/users.js and suggest improvements"
```

### Example 2: Security Audit

```bash
/agent security-specialist
"Review authentication implementation in /src/middleware/auth.js for vulnerabilities"
```

### Example 3: Understanding Complex Code

```bash
/code-explain How does the payment processing workflow handle retries and failures?
```

### Example 4: Performance Investigation

```bash
/agent performance-engineer
"The dashboard page loads slowly. Help identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities."
```
