# Testing Your Claude Code Marketplace

## What Was Fixed

Your marketplace had an incorrect structure where plugin entries pointed to individual `.md` files:
```json
"source": "./plugins/analyze-issue.md"  // ❌ Wrong
```

Now it uses the correct structure with shared command/agent directories:
```json
"source": ".",                          // ✓ Correct
"commands": "./commands/analyze-issue.md"
```

## New Structure

```
.claude-plugin/
├── marketplace.json         # 113 total plugins
├── commands/               # 35 command files (shared)
│   ├── analyze-issue.md
│   ├── commit.md
│   └── ...
└── agents/                 # 78 agent files (shared)
    ├── accessibility-expert.md
    ├── ai-engineer.md
    └── ...
```

## How to Test

### 1. Test Locally
```bash
# Add your local marketplace
/plugin marketplace add /Users/anandtyagi/Desktop/claude-code-marketplace

# Try installing a command
/plugin install analyze-issue@claude-code-marketplace

# Try installing an agent
/plugin install ai-engineer@claude-code-marketplace
```

### 2. Test from GitHub (after pushing)
```bash
# Add from GitHub
/plugin marketplace add <your-username>/claude-code-marketplace

# Install plugins
/plugin install analyze-issue@claude-code-marketplace
```

## Expected Result

Plugins should now install successfully without the "failed to load" error!
